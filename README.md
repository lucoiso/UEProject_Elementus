![HighresScreenshot00000](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77353979/171550569-09dc7c78-c921-4b60-92a1-0a50b9e8ccca.png)

**This project is being built on Unreal Engine 5.1**

## About

Project Elementus was intended to be a third person template that can be used to start projects that will use some new features that come with Unreal Engine 5 as well as powerful existing features like the Gameplay Ability System and others. And now, **Project Elementus was turned into a sample project and its content was moved to a new plugin**! :)

As a plugin, it is easier to organize and insert the content into already existing projects, facilitating maintenance and usability.

This plugin has it's own repository where you can check it for more details: https://github.com/lucoiso/UEElementusModules
