**This project is being built on Unreal Engine 5.1**

## About

Project Elementus is a third person template that can be used to start projects that will use some new features that
come with Unreal Engine 5 as well as powerful existing features like the Gameplay Ability System and others!

My intention with this development is to help other developers in their projects by providing a starting point with
already implemented functionalities. ❤️

I will be posting updates frequently on this forum
