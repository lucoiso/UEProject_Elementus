**This project is being built on Unreal Engine 5.0.x.**

## About

Project Elementus is a third person template that can be used to start projects that will use some new features that
come with Unreal
Engine 5 as well as powerful existing features like the Gameplay Ability System and others!

My intention with this development is to help other developers in their projects by providing a starting point with
already implemented functionalities. ❤️

I will be posting updates frequently on this forum
thread: [Epic Developer Community](https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/project-elementus-custom-tps-template-w-extra-features/273595)  
Please give some feedback and feel invited to test the project and help me with this work. : )
